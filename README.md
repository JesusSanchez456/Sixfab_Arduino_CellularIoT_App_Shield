# Sixfab Arduino Cellular IoT Library 
This is library Sixfab Arduino Cellular IoT Application Shield.

# Product Description
This is a shield that has combined LTE technologies Cat.M1, Cat.NB1 (NB-IoT) and eGPRS for Arduino, based on Quectel’s BG96 module. The shield has the power of new IoT phenomenon LPWA (Low Power Wide Area) with Cat.M1 and NB-IoT connection functionalities. Besides, it also provides the function of eGPRS that be enhanced version of classical GPRS.

The shield has GNSS (GPS, GLONASS etc.) functionality for the need of location, navigation, tracking, mapping and timing applications.

The design has built-in temperature, humidity, light sensors, 3-axis accelerometer, and a relay.
